\section{Employment / Volunteering}

\vspace{6pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\cventry{October 2016--March 2017}{Teaching Assistant (part-time)}{Technical University of Munich}{Munich}{}{\vspace{3pt}At the chair of computer technology and computer organization I am responsible for two tutorials of the lecture "Introduction to Computer Organization and Technology - Computer Architecture". My tutorials are visited by approx. 60 students (bachelor and master courses). Additionally I am available for consultation and will be grading the exams.}}

\item{\cventry{January 2015--today}{System Administrator (part-time)}{Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität}{Munich}{}{\vspace{3pt}
At the faculty of physics, I am currently responsible for maintaining servers and user work stations. Particularly it is my job to check and apply security patches and ensure a smooth experience for our users. For the latter, I provide support in regard to computing and printing problems. I volunteered to give lectures for students at the faculty, e.g. as instruction to our operating systems and services or security lectures. I participated in various projects, such as deploying Gitlab (solely responsible, for testing purposes), maintaining an existing information tool displaying users and workload and currently implementing Apache Hadoop in our systems.}}

\item{\cventry{June 2016--October 2016}{Community Mentor (volunteer)}{Coursera}{Munich}{}
{\vspace{3pt}
As a Community Mentor I help other learners on Coursera with both technical and subject questions and help to provide an essential link between the instructors (and creators of the course) and learners. I also give      feedback to Coursera and participate in monthly video conference meetings.}}

\item{\cventry{September 2012}{Station Master Intern}{DB Netz AG}{Passau}{}
{\vspace{3pt}
During a week-long internship at the local division of DB Netz AG - the infrastructure provider in the Deutsche Bahn concern - I learnt about the various systems playing together to make a train journey possible. I was able to
learn to manually guide a train from start to its destination, about communication between various station and to handle emergencies.}}

\subsection{Completed Courses}

\vspace{5pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Lab Course - Computer Architecture} \textit{Grade: 1.7}

\vspace{2pt}

\small{Solving two term-long projects in assembly and microprogramming with two fellow students.}}

\item{\textbf{Fundamentals of Programming (Exercises \& Laboratory)} \textit{Grade: 1.0}

\vspace{2pt}
\small{Java Programming. Smaller problems had to be solved each week during the term. Included one final capstone project (with GUI).}}

\item{\textbf{Introduction to Computer Organization and Technology - Computer Architecture} \textit{Grade: 2.0}}

\item{\textbf{Introduction to Informatics 1} \textit{Grade: 2.0}}

\item{\textbf{Computational Methods (for physicists)} \textit{Grade: 1.0}}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coursera Courses}

\vspace{5pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Big Data Specialization (ongoing):} \textit{'Big Data by University of California, San Diego', current Grade: 100\%}

\vspace{2pt}

\small{"Drive better business decisions with an overview of how big data is organized, analyzed, and interpreted. Apply your insights to real-world problems and questions."\\
The course involved both theory and practical training, e.g. graph analytics and ML applications. I could gain a large insight on Apache Hadoop's ecosystem
and was able to work with it using cloudera's VM distribution. I am yet to complete the capstone project starting in June 2016.}}

\item{\textbf{Machine Learning Specialization (ongoing):} \textit{'Build Intelligent Applications by University of Washington', current Grade: 100\%}

\vspace{2pt}

\small{"This Specialization provides a case-based introduction to the exciting, high-demand field of machine learning."\\
This course offers a far more theoretical approach to machine learning than the big data specialization did. What I like most about it, is the immediate 
application of knowledge in Python using Dato GraphLab via Jupyter Notebook.}}
